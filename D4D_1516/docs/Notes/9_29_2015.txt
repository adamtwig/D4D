* Hexagonal binning
- Start developing visualization / hexagonal binning in Python
- Can find research idea while diving into the data

parallelize python code?

* Assume we are doing hexagonal binning on home locations, go from raw data and use functions, play with them
* Alter definition of home and work location to 7pm-7am. How much does a minor change affect results? Does culture come into effect, Spain goes home for 3 hours

Orange Definition / Assumption
7pm - 7am

Assumption Used
Most calls in a location

Improved Assumption
- low variability
- weekends vs weekdays
- find cultural differences
- what if someone moved over course of a year?

To Do: Does changing the home assumption have a large effect or not?

Set 2

Matrix 1 (number of calls at antenna by person) -> can find most popular location using this
     antenna1 ant2 ant3
id0     3           5          100
id1     7           8           90

Matrix 2 (nighttime)
*same structure, but only count calls between 7pm-7am

Matrix 3 (daytime)
*same structure, but this time 7am -7pm

Matrix 4 (weekends)
*same structure, but this time only count on weekends
