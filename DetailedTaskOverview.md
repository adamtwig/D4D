##### Movement Statistics/Geography



* Adam -- Enumerate a single user's abstract pattern of movements
* Adam -- Alter user home location for daily (365 out-values per user)
* Adam -- Develop an abstract graph in D3.js using movement patterns
* Adam -- Clustering similar users/home locations by 2-mers, 3-mers, 4-mers, ...
* Bishal -- Heat map for aggregate migration between arrondisements by month
* Bishal -- Visualization for month by month migration by user
* Matt -- Aggregate patterns by each user (i.e. User 1, Pattern 1, count)
* Matt -- How active is a user? (Generate summary statistics/histogram on 2-mer AA vs. AB)
* Matt -- How well-travelled is a user? (Amount of unique 2-mers vs. 3-mers vs. 4-mers ...)
* Matt -- Does definition of home location matter? (statistically significant difference)
* Michael -- Interactivity of Senegal with arrondisement boundaries using D3.js   
* Michael -- Plotting antennas in Senegal using D3.js
* Morgan -- Generate voronoi diagram by antenna locations
* Morgan -- How often does a user move? (i.e. average time of movement by user by home location)
* Morgan -- What time of day is the most active for movement?
* Morgan -- Does time of year matter? (statistically significant difference)
