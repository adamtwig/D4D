Raw data stays on Okami / DEN computers
Aggregated / summary statistics / metadata can be shared anywhere / publication

Can use small dummy data for workflow, script tests to see if working

Does synthetic data set exist?
Could we use bandicoot indicators to see if synthetic data set is faithful?
Adding noise but still making useful, Virginia Tech?

Machine learning, can we predict which nation based on personality characteristics?
But, if very little differences between Senegal and Ivory Coast?

Start with raw data set and use generalization or suppression to fuzzy data
Or do we generate a synthetic data set based on characteristics of model?

Supression skews results.


Machine learning techniques
Neural networks
Decision trees

Break up into parallel groups


Reading up on synthetic data sets,
how do generate?
