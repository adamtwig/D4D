visualization
archGIS - color by arrondisement
can archGIS do animation?

14 regions
45 departments
122 arrondisements



veronoi diagram
partition country by antennas -> 1066 antennas / sites

color antennas based on people
aggregate all antennas in an arrondisement
what about connections between towers? -> draw line of particular width

how many people make calls during day versus during night
each antenna has two bars, one for day and one for night

go from story and see if data correlates
for every user, where was home location
do we someone move to different location?

large geographical migrations -> traffic patterns
by arrondisement -> dataset 3

holidays
senegal is 98% muslim
can look at texts, calls

get home locations for everyone
look at two week period for independence day
and see if their homes change?
huge flooding in dakar in 2013

scale down, and see if correct when running small sample with runtime of minute


matrix is very sparse (lots of zeroes), anything more efficient?
list of lists -> why not a list of dictionaries
users -> sites
but how do we get a count of each site

how do we show movement of data with visualization?
show paths of people migrating

for home locations, overall, nighttime, daytime
is there difference between aggregation (dataset 2) vs. just on arrondissement
level (dataset 3)?
