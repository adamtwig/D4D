Sort antenna frequency.

Run processes in background.
Run matlib in background too to generate images. Okay to not do interactive.

Definitions of homes
Michael -> filtering for different definitions of homes data sets

ArchGIS
Bishal -> Tell us what format he needs to have antennas in a column
Because we already have coordinates for each antennaid
Link antennaid like primary keys across data csv

Python script to load data and export the visualization
1. Load a dataset
2. Turn layer on
3. Export png

This way we could create animation of all the PNG files.

Actually, can also do animation in ArchGIS.
See which approach is better.


Time element. To do an entire year, need to go to arrondisement level, but this doesn't change so much.
Is there a monthly / seasonal cycle we can look for at arr. level. 
% change over time for an entire year.

We can get 2 week period movements. And we can look at some specific, day event to see if correlates with data.

Get different definitions of home working for both antenna and arrondissement.
Then can move to arrondisement.
