Actually in a Muslim country, weekend is usually Friday and Saturday



Make some progress notes
For writing papers, nice to have documentation to track
Valid results vs invalid results, version control, runtime, etc.

Read the document from Wolffe

Binning number of people who make # of calls
Look for weekends, 
In entire two week period, avg contacts per day
Datasets 2 and 3 have indicators from bandicoot

Approach
1) Pick specific story, and hone research from there
2) Start doing generic research and see if data jumps out

Clustering on datasets
which starts with measuring
defining similarity, distance metric

How many different clusters can we find?
Clustering is tough because its a continuum
If we look at clusters between antennas?


Go through individual indicators
Look at metrics that aren't helpful
Can we combine 2 week period cluterings? or do we need to do them differently?
Very small chance because less than 1% is sampled, so less worry that
same user will be matched since Orange fuzzied data for userid, could be same 
person
However, time makes things differently, and geospatial variables

Start small
K means clustering
