#### Adam - Abstract Patterns
##### Main Tasks
* Enumerate a single user's abstract pattern of movements
* Alter user home location for daily (365 out-values per user)
* Develop an abstract graph in D3.js using movement patterns
* Clustering similar users/home locations by 2-mers, 3-mers, 4-mers, ...

#### Bishal - Migration
##### Main Tasks
* Heat map for aggregate migration between arrondisements by month
* Visualization for month by month migration by user

#### Matt - Time
##### Intro Task
* Aggregate patterns by each user (i.e. User 1, Pattern 1, count)
##### Motivating Questions
* How often does a user move?
* What time of day is the most active for movement?
* Does time of year matter? 
* (i.e. average time of movement by user by home location)

#### Michael - Interactive Visualization
##### Main Tasks
* Interactivity of Senegal with arrondisement boundaries using D3.js   
* Plotting antennas in Senegal using D3.js

#### Morgan - Movement Statistics/Geography
##### Intro Task
* Generate voronoi diagram by antenna locations
##### Motivating Questions
* How active is a user? 
* (Generate summary statistics/histogram on 2-mer AA vs. AB)
* How well-travelled is a user?
* (Amount of unique 2-mers vs. 3-mers vs. 4-mers ...)
* Does definition of home location matter? (statistically significant difference)
